# MAS Sprite Schema

This project is aimed to provide precise JSON schema files for static analysis and validation of Monika After Story
spritepack JSON files without a need to test them by launching the mod.


## Coverage

Currently, no schema files were tested against real world spritepack JSON files. However, schema files work fine
with examples shown on [Monika After Story wiki page](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/wiki/Adding-Sprite-Objects#json-format).
